# Farm-Management-System
In current scenario, Farmers face a lot of difficulties due to lack of knowledge 
and platform to raise their questions. Our project, Integrated Crop Management 
System, aims to solve these difficulties in the field of Aggrotech. This website 
displays lists of fertilizers, pesticides, tools with images and crop policies. It also 
provides functionality for users to ask questions with crop name, problem 
description along with image if necessary. Previously asked questions with 
solutions from agronomists are displayed. This is built using HTML, CSS in 
frontend, MYSQL with PYTHON FLASK as backend and connector. With 
successful completion of this project, we now have a clear understanding of 
building an ER Model, transforming it to Relational and Schema model and 
optimizing the relations with normalization. We also have a clear view of how 
database management systems are essential to user applications and how stack 
development takes place.
